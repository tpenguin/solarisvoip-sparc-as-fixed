There is a bug in the Solaris/11 sparc assembler that causes incorrect
builds of asterisk.  The symtoms are an immediate crash when asterisk
starts, due to errors in the generated symbol tables.

The file
   "sparc-as-fixed"
when installed as /usr/ccs/bin/as, and used with the gcc in
/usr/sfb/bin that comes with Solaris should fix the problem.

Note this is only a "test" fix that hasn't been completely tested.
As soon as an official patch is generated, this "test" version of as
will be removed, and replaced with the patch.
